Consider following code to answer further questions:
import pandas as pd
course_name = [‘Data Science’, ‘Machine Learning’, ‘Big Data’, ‘Data Engineer’]
duration = [2,3,6,4]
df = pd.DataFrame(data = {‘course_name’ : course_name, ‘duration’ : duration})

Q1. Write a code to print the data present in the second row of the dataframe, df.
ANS. 
course_name = ['Data Science', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Data Engineer']
duration = [2,3,6,4]
df = pd.DataFrame(data = {'course_name': course_name, 'duration' : duration})

df.loc[1]
course_name    Machine Learning
duration                      3
Name: 1, dtype: object


Q2. What is the difference between the functions loc and iloc in pandas.DataFrame?
ans. import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]}, index=[0, 1, 2])

# Using loc to select rows and columns based on their labels
print(df.loc[1, 'B'])  # Output: 5
print(df.loc[1:2, 'B':'C'])  # Output:
#    B  C
# 1  5  8
# 2  6  9

# Using iloc to select rows and columns based on their integer positions
print(df.iloc[1, 1])  # Output: 5
print(df.iloc[1:3, 1:3])  # Output:
#    B  C
# 1  5  8
# 2  6  9

oc is used to select rows and columns based on their labels.
iloc is used to select rows and columns based on their integer positions.
loc uses inclusive slicing, i.e., the end index is included in the output, whereas iloc uses exclusive slicing, i.e., the end index is not included in the output.
loc can accept boolean arrays as indices.
iloc requires integers as indices.




Q3. Reindex the given dataframe using a variable, reindex = [3,0,1,2] and store it in the variable, new_df
then find the output for both new_df.loc[2] and new_df.iloc[2].
ans. 
import pandas as pd
course_name = ['Data Science', 'Machine Learning', 'Big Data', 'Data Engineer']
duration = [2,3,6,4]
df = pd.DataFrame(data = {'course_name': course_name, 'duration' : duration}
df1 = df.reindex([3,0,1,2])

df1.loc[2]
output--
course_name    Big Data
duration              6
Name: 2, dtype: object

df1.iloc[2]
output--
course_name    Machine Learning
duration                      3
Name: 1, dtype: object


Did you observe any difference in both the outputs? If so then explain it.
Consider the below code to answer further questions:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
columns = ['column_1', 'column_2', 'column_3', 'column_4', 'column_5', 'column_6']
indices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
#Creating a dataframe:
df1 = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(6,6), columns = columns, index = indices)

Q4. Write a code to find the following statistical measurements for the above dataframe df1:
(i) mean of each and every column present in the dataframe.







(ii) standard deviation of column, ‘column_2’




Q5. Replace the data present in the second row of column, ‘column_2’ by a string variable then find the
mean of column, column_2.
If you are getting errors in executing it then explain why.
[Hint: To replace the data use df1.loc[] and equate this to string data of your choice.]



Q6. What do you understand about the windows function in pandas and list the types of windows
functions?



Q7. Write a code to print only the current month and year at the time of answering this question.
[Hint: Use pandas.datetime function]



Q8. Write a Python program that takes in two dates as input (in the format YYYY-MM-DD) and
calculates the difference between them in days, hours, and minutes using Pandas time delta. The
program should prompt the user to enter the dates and display the result.




Q9. Write a Python program that reads a CSV file containing categorical data and converts a specified
column to a categorical data type. The program should prompt the user to enter the file path, column
name, and category order, and then display the sorted data.



Q10. Write a Python program that reads a CSV file containing sales data for different products and
visualizes the data using a stacked bar chart to show the sales of each product category over time. The
program should prompt the user to enter the file path and display the chart.





Q11. You are given a CSV file containing student data that includes the student ID and their test score. Write
a Python program that reads the CSV file, calculates the mean, median, and mode of the test scores, and
displays the results in a table.
The program should do the followingM
I Prompt the user to enter the file path of the CSV file containing the student dataR
I Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrameR
I Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the test scores using Pandas toolsR
I Display the mean, median, and mode in a table.
Assume the CSV file contains the following columnsM
I Student ID: The ID of the studentR
I Test Score: The score of the student's test.
Example usage of the program:
Enter the file path of the CSV file containing the student data: student_data.csv
+-----------+--------+
| Statistic | Value |
+-----------+--------+
| Mean | 79.6 |
| Median | 82 |
| Mode | 85, 90 |
+-----------+--------+
Assume that the CSV file student_data.csv contains the following data:
Student ID,Test Score
1,85
2,90
3,80
4,75
5,85
6,82
7,78
8,85
9,90
10,85
The program should calculate the mean, median, and mode of the test scores and display the results
in a table.
